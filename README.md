# Sign Language Recognition System 👋
<p >
A real-time Sign Language Recognition System using computer vision and deep learning.<br>
This project captures and classifies hand gesture data (numbers & alphabets) through a CNN model built with TensorFlow/Keras. It utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe for accurate hand tracking and gesture recognition.
</p>

## Tech Stack Used🛠️👾
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **OpenCV**: For image and video capture & processing
- **MediaPipe**: Detects hand landmarks/keypoints
- **Cvzone**: Simplifies integration between OpenCV and MediaPipe
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: For building and training the CNN model
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Used for gesture classification 

*Note: This system is designed to work for both right and left-hand signers*

## Display💻
*Coming soon: Screenshots or demo video of the working system!*
